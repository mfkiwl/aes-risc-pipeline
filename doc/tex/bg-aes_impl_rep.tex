A field element in $\F_{2^8}$ can be represented by an
$8$-bit byte,
where the $i$-th bit of $x$ for $0 \leq i < 8$ represents the $i$-th 
polynomial coefficient.

Beyond this, the state and round key matrices can be represented in
several ways.
The most direct option would be termed
array-based (or unpacked):
the matrix is represented as a $16$-element array of $8$-bit bytes, each
representing field elements.
%FIPS-197~\cite{FIPS:197} defines a word to be st. $w = 32$.
We use $R$ to refer to the register width of a target platform.
For RISC-V, $R = \RVXLEN$ where we consider $\RVXLEN \in {32,64}$.
Where $R \geq  32$,
an entire row or column of the AES state matrix can be packed into each 
register:
we term these
   ``row-packed''  
and
``column-packed''
representations respectively.
Where $R \geq 128$, 
it is plausible to pack
an entire AES state matrix
into a single register: 
we term this a 
 ``fully-packed'' 
representation.

In a hardware-only implementation,
execution of 
AES
is 
performed by 
a dedicated hardware module (e.g., a memory-mapped co-processor),
while
the software which uses AES is executed on
a general-purpose CPU core.
A large design space exists for hardware implementations of AES.
Gaj and Chodowiec~\cite[Section 3.3]{GajCho:00}
give an overview, detailing
iterative,
combinatorial (unrolled),
and
pipelined architectures.
Similarly, ~\cite{PMDW:04,GooBen:05,GajCho:09}
survey concrete implementations on a variety of fabrics including FPGAs
and ASICs.

Although hardware-only designs are not our focus, the associated techniques
can guide ISE-related design choices.
First,
they guide the ISE interface.
For example, some ISEs can be characterised as offering an interface to
hardware constituting one round 
(i.e., aligned with an iterative hardware implementation).
Second,
they guide the ISE implementation.
For example, a significant body of work focuses on efficient hardware 
implementation of the S-box: ~\cite{Canright:05,BoyPer:12,ReyTahAsh:18}.

- Apply all editorial comments from the reviews.

- Briefly introduce AES in the background section; one or two paragraphs
introducing the terminology (MixColums, ShiftRows, ...), the round-based
design, and the parameter version is sufficient but necessary.

- Describe the impact on performance metrics to your implementations, if
the decoding functionality was to be removed when using only AES-GCM.

- Provide timing information corresponding to the operating frequencies
of the different implementations and discuss the effect of the ISEs on
the frequency.

- Explain why variant 3 is so expensive in terms of cycles for the key
expansion of decryption.

- Provide performance data of a 64-bit base line implementation for
comparison to variant 4.

- Provide an overall summary of the results in the abstract.

- Clarify what ISAs are targeted in the description of related work.

- Report a quantitative comparison to results in related work on RISC-V
ISEs for [Saa20] and [TGS05].

- Provide tool and metric details in the experimental data (Table 1 and
2); see Review #24C.

- Briefly discuss possible causes for the penalty on version 5 decryption.

- 'Fix' the differing instruction counts due to function calling behavior.

- Remove the SCA section (but please save and extend it to another
future paper).

- Use the additional space for a more detailed description of the AES
variants and their implementation, in particular of your new variant.

- Extend and strengthen the discussion on GCM.

- Bring crucial information from the appendix back into the paper.

- Make full use of the 20 available pages (see CHES paper instructions).
